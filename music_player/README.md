# Music Player

A very nice template that show artist songs. When a song is tapped then a nice modal bottom sheet that stands as a player for selected song is shown to the user.
These screenshot have been taken on iPhone 12 Pro.
The app is made adaptive and where the case is the bottom sheet becomes scrollable avoiding bottom overflow.
